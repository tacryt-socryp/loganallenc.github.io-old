    	<p class="paragraph">For publishers we will allow users to pay a "subscription fee" - these fees will encourage publishers to keep allowing their valuable content to be displayed in our app.

    	<p class="paragraph">Our app directly subsidizes independent writers using crowd funding. Apps like Feedly and Flipboard take away money from writers, yet they are two of the most successfully funded news reading apps. With my app, whenever a user likes an article, they are able to seamlessly donate to the writer. Microdonations ($0.10, donated by many people) for quality articles encourages the creation of more articles of such quality, and also provide a way to monetize the massive user base that news reading apps have garnered.</p>
