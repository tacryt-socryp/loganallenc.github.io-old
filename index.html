        <p>I'm a high school senior living in Gainesville, GA. I'm passionate about technology, startups, and open source (especially Mozilla). I drink excessive amounts of coffee, run cross country, and love <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/loganfynne">music</a>&mdash;mostly electronic and indie folk.</p>
        <p>I'm enrolled at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and will begin pursuing a major in Computer Science in the fall of 2014. Feel free to reach out!</p>

<h2>What I've Been Up To</h2>
<h3>2014</h3>

<ul>I just accepted an offer for a paid summer internship at <a href="https://gatherhere.com/">Gather</a> to work as a front-end software engineer.</ul>
        
<ul>I've interned at <a href="http://triplingo.com/">TripLingo</a> as a software developer and am using JavaScript and Appcelerator Titanium to reimagine their translation app for use in a medical translation context.</ul>

<ul>I've worked alongside <a href="http://michaeltavani.com/">Michael Tavani</a>, CEO of Scoutmob, and <a href="http://blog.sourcebender.com/">Calvin Yu</a>, CTO of Scoutmob, to write an iPhone app called <a href="http://loganallen.co/anchor/">Anchor</a> for keeping track of conversations with acquaintances and business connections.</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top:5%;">2013</h3>

<ul>I worked alongside <a href="http://rushir.co">Rushir Parikh</a> to found Clerk, a news app that allowed users to give back to authors through microdonations. Our startup was mentored and advised by <a href="http://finette.com/">Pascal Finette</a>, the past Chair of the Board of Mozilla, and <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieharding">Charlie Harding</a>, a program manager at Google.</ul>

<ul>I developed software for <a href="http://bestfitmobile.com/">BestFit Mobile</a> as an independent contractor, acting as the lead front-end developer on a contract with <a href="http://www.fmcna.com/fmcna/index.htm">Fresenius Medical Care</a>, a dialysis company with 55,000 employees.</ul>
<ul>I wrote a conference room booking app called <a href="https://github.com/loganallenc/confluent">Confluent</a> for internal use at BestFit that utilized OAuth 2.0 and Google Calendar.</ul>
